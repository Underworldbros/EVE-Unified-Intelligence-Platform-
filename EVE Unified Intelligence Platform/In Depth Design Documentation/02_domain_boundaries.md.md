**Outputs:**  
- Interactive, zoomable universe map  
- System congestion heatmaps  
- Site availability and competition indicators  
- Route planning suggestions  

**Interactions:**

- Dynamic overlays are **optional and user-toggleable**  

---

## Domain 5: Game Events & System Pressure Modeling

**Scope:**  
- Track large-scale events that influence player behavior  
- Quantify **system pressure** using a composite index  

**Inputs:**  
- Incursion, invasion, and faction warfare data  
- Player jump and NPC kill metrics  
- User-run history (optional for local weighting)  

**Outputs:**  
- System Pressure Index (SPI) per system  
- Visual alerts for high-activity systems  
- Event spillover projections for adjacent systems  

**Interactions:**  
- Map & Traffic Intelligence (overlays)  
- Run History & Calendar (event-informed planning)  

**Design Notes:**  
- Indexes system “busyness” relative to historical norms  
- Alerts and recommendations are **heuristic and adjustable**  

---

## Domain 6: Player Tracking & Threat Awareness

**Scope:**  
- Maintain intelligence on player threats (gankers, competitors)  
- Track corporations and alliances  

**Inputs:**  
- zKillboard data  
- EVEWho lookup data  
- User-defined player and corp tagging

- Alerts for dangerous players or regions  

**Interactions:**  
- Map & Traffic Intelligence (threat overlays)  
- Calendar/Notifications (threat alerts for planned runs)  

**Design Notes:**  
- Heuristic-based scoring, **adjustable by user**  
- Focused on actionable awareness, not policing  

---

## Domain 7: Ship Fitting & Operational Costs

**Scope:**  
- Track player ships and fits  
- Calculate recurring operational expenses  

**Inputs:**  
- User-defined ship fits (manual or import)

### Closing Statement
These **domain boundaries** define the scope, responsibilities, and interfaces for each module. They ensure that the system is:
- **Modular** — each domain can evolve independently  
- **Action-oriented** — outputs guide player decisions  
- **Transparent** — inputs and calculations are clear  
- **Extensible & Scalable** — new domains or modules can be added without disruption  

---

Next steps involve **technical architecture mapping**, showing how each domain interacts, the data flow between modules, and persistence/caching strategies.
