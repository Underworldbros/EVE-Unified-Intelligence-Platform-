## Monetization & Sustainability — EVE Online Unified Intelligence Application

### Purpose of this Document
This document defines the **monetization strategy and sustainability plan** for the EVE Online Unified Intelligence Application.  

The goal is to provide **funding and infrastructure support** for long-term development without violating CCP policies or compromising the integrity of analytics and user trust.

---

## 1. Legal & Policy Constraints
- The application is **primarily for personal use**. Direct sale is legally prohibited under EVE Online’s EULA for third-party tools with primary gameplay impact.  
- Monetization must comply with **CCP third-party tool policies**, including:
  - No paywalled gameplay advantages
  - No sale of in-game assets for real money
  - Transparent handling of user contributions  

**Implication:** Any monetization mechanism should **support development costs** but not restrict functionality, create unfair advantage, or violate EULA rules.

---

## 2. Monetization Goals
- Cover **infrastructure and hosting costs** for API data, caching, and storage  
- Support **scalable architecture** as more modules and data sources are integrated  
- Fund **ongoing development and maintenance** without commercializing the app  
- Maintain **ethical alignment** with community expectations and player trust

---

## 3. ISK-Based Contributions
**Concept:** Voluntary in-game ISK donations, inspired by tools like EVE Tycoon and EVEeye.

**Mechanics:**
- Public wallet addresses are displayed for transparency  
- Users may contribute ISK voluntarily  
- Recognition can be given in non-gameplay ways (e.g., contributor listing in the app, cosmetic badges)  
- No gameplay advantage or access restriction is tied to contributions  

**Rationale:**  
- Aligns with EVE culture of voluntary community support  
- Avoids real-world currency transactions, which may introduce compliance or tax complications  
- Provides sustainable funding for infrastructure without compromising neutrality

---

## 4. Advertising Support
**Concept:** Non-intrusive banner advertising.

**Guidelines:**
- Placement restricted to sidebar or footer  
- Avoid pop-ups or disruptive formats  
- Ads do not interfere with dashboard readability or analytics outputs  
- Optional “supporter mode” could hide ads for voluntary contributors  

**Rationale:**  
- Generates additional infrastructure support  
- Maintains a lightweight user experience  
- Keeps monetization ethical and non-competitive  

---

## 5. Transparency & Ethics
All monetization strategies adhere to the following principles:
- **Neutrality:** Analytics, alerts, and recommendations are unaffected by contributions or ads  
- **Visibility:** Users are aware of how contributions are used  
- **Non-intrusiveness:** Monetization does not disrupt core functionality or usability  
- **Compliance:** Continual monitoring of CCP policy changes ensures legality

---

## 6. Sustainability Measures
To maintain long-term viability, the following practices are recommended:
1. **Efficient API Usage:**  
   - Minimize redundant requests  
   - Implement caching layers  
   - Support offline/low-connectivity modes  

2. **Resource Management:**  
   - Monitor database growth  
   - Archive historical data where feasible  
   - Optimize backend computations for scalability  

3. **Community Engagement:**  
   - Encourage voluntary contributions for those who benefit from advanced analytics  
   - Offer transparency reports detailing donations, infrastructure costs, and update frequency  

---

### Closing Statement
The monetization strategy is designed to **support the project without compromising its purpose or legality**.  
It balances **optional community contributions** with ethical advertising and sustainable development practices, ensuring the application remains a **trusted, player-focused intelligence tool** for the long term.

**Next Steps:**
- Define ISK contribution workflow (addresses, verification, recognition)  
- Draft advertising guidelines and integration plan  
- Track ongoing infrastructure costs to inform voluntary contribution recommendations
