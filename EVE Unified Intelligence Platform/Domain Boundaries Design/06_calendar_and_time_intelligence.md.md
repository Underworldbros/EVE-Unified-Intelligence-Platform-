## Calendar, Events & Time Intelligence

---

## Purpose of This Domain

The Calendar domain acts as the **temporal coordination layer** for the application.

It unifies:
- In-game events
- Player- and organization-defined schedules
- Economic and conflict milestones
- Real-world and EVE-time alignment

The calendar exists to answer:
- *What is happening?*
- *When does it matter?*
- *How does time affect planning and decisions?*

---

## Core Calendar Scope

The calendar includes:
- Automated event ingestion
- Manual event creation
- Cross-domain intelligence events
- Time conversion and labeling

It is informational and organizational, not directive.

---

## Event Sources

### EVE API–Driven Events

- Scheduled in-game activities

Events are:

---

## Date Context

- Collapse/expand behavior

---

## Visual Customization

All visual elements are optional and user-controlled.

---

## UI Integration

- Behavior similar to Edencom notifications
- Quick-glance view

### Dedicated Calendar Window

---

## Cross-Domain Integration

Calendar entries can link to:
- Map locations
- Intelligence reports
- Market events
- Player or corporation profiles

Likewise, other domains can surface time-bound events into the calendar.

---

## Design Philosophy Summary

- Time awareness is a strategic advantage
- No event is forced onto the user
- Automation augments memory; it does not replace judgment
- Temporal context is as important as spatial or financial context

---

### Closing Statement

The Calendar domain ensures that **when things happen** is never disconnected from **why they matter**.

It binds gameplay, economics, conflict, and planning into a coherent temporal framework without imposing workflow or intent.
